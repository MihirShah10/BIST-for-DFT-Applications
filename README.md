# BIST-for-DFT-Applications
The Project files attached refer to creating a Built-in Self Test for testing of any combinational circuit.The code is written in VHDL Hardware Descriptive Language. In my example the Circuit-Under-Test (CUT) is a 4 bit multiplier and a sixth order LFSR and MISR to make the system on-chip testable.
